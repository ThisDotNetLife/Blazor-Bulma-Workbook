# Blazor-Bulma-Workbook
This project is my workbook from the Udemy course 
[Master Bulma CSS framework and code 4 projects with 14 pages](https://www.udemy.com/course/bulma-responsive-web-design-and-development/) - but with a twist. 
This project is built using Microsoft .NET 5 Blazor Web Assembly (WASM).

As I progress through the course, I plan to create a branch for each major section from the course. 
By converting the instructor's code from HTML to Blazor, I should gain enough experience and become fluent in the Razor syntax.

### Main Branch - Section 01
The main branch contains the basics. Bootstrap has been removed replaced with a local copy of Bulma 0.9.1 and Fontawesome 5.13.0. I've also included Bulma badges in the project and tried to clean-up the interface. Still, not a bad start for a Sunday morning/afternoon project.
